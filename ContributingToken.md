# Contributing to the Wefacelook Token

Welcome to the guide for contributing to the Wefacelook token project. This document provides detailed guidelines for developers who want to contribute to the development of the token and customize it to their project specifications.

## Token Description

The Wefacelook token is an ERC-20 token based on the Ethereum platform, designed with additional features to support a reward and incentive program, staking and DeFi, decentralized governance, burn and buyback mechanisms, utility specific to the fashion industry, and NFTs and collectibles. The token will be used as a means of payment on the Wefacelook platform and within the marketplace that will be developed in the future. Users will be able to purchase clothes and other goods within the platform using Wefacelook tokens.

Additionally, the token will be distributed through a cryptocurrency exchange or other available payment methods. The proceeds generated by the token will be used to fund further developments of the platform or to reward users who actively participate in the community.

The token contract will support all standard ERC-20 features, including transferability, control of the maximum supply, and the ability to create new tokens. Furthermore, it will include custom features for the Wefacelook platform as discussed below.

## Prerequisites

To contribute to the development of the Wefacelook token, developers must have a deep understanding of Ethereum and smart contracts. In particular, knowledge of the following tools and technologies is required:

- Solidity: the programming language used to write smart contracts on Ethereum.
- Truffle: a framework for developing and testing smart contracts on Ethereum.
- Ganache: a local testing environment for the Ethereum platform.
- Web3.js: a JavaScript library used to interact with smart contracts on Ethereum.

Additionally, developers are encouraged to have experience in creating smart contracts on Ethereum and managing transactions on the platform.

## Token Contract Structure

The Wefacelook token contract is written in Solidity and follows ERC-20 standards. The contract includes the following variables:

- name: the name of the token (e.g. Wefacelook Token).
- symbol: the symbol of the token (e.g. WFCT).
- decimals: the number of decimal places to represent the value of the token.
- totalSupply: the total quantity of issued tokens.
- balances: a mapping that associates token holder addresses with their respective balances.
- allowances: a mapping that associates token holder addresses with their respective transfer permissions.

The contract will support all standard ERC-20 features, including the transfer, balanceOf, and approve functions. Additionally, the contract will also include custom features for the Wefacelook platform, such as:

- Reward and incentive program
- Staking and DeFi integration
- Decentralized governance
- Burn and buyback mechanisms
- Utility specific to the fashion industry
- NFTs and collectibles

## Customizing the Token

Developers who want to use the Wefacelook token in their own project can customize it to their project specifications. For example, developers can modify the name and symbol of the token to reflect their brand or add custom functionality to the token contract.

To customize the token, developers can clone the token repository from GitHub and make the necessary modifications to the token contract. The new token contract can then be compiled and distributed on the Ethereum platform.

## Security and Code Testing

To ensure the security of the Wefacelook token contract, developers are required to follow best security practices for smart contracts on Ethereum. In particular, it is important to:

- Always validate user input and use appropriate validity checks.
- Avoid excessive complexity of the contract to reduce the possibility of errors or security vulnerabilities.
- Use standardized data structures and algorithms that have been well-tested.
- Test the contract on a private network or on a local testing environment like Ganache before deploying it on the Ethereum platform.

Developers can use the Truffle framework to write automated tests for the token contract. The tests should cover all the contract's features and ensure that there are no vulnerabilities or errors in the code.

## Opening a Pull Request

Developers who want to contribute to the development of the Wefacelook token can do so by opening a pull request on the project's GitHub repository. To open a pull request:

1. Fork the Wefacelook token repository on GitHub.
2. Clone the repository on your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for the changes you intend to make.
4. Make the changes to the token contract.
5. Test to ensure that all features are still working and there are no security vulnerabilities or errors.
6. Execute the `git push` command to upload your changes to your forked repository.
7. Open a pull request from your forked repository to the main branch of the Wefacelook project.

Once the pull request is opened, the Wefacelook team will review the changes and provide any feedback or suggestions. When the pull request is accepted, your changes will be integrated into the Wefacelook token code.
