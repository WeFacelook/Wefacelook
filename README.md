# WeFacelook
WeFacelook is an open-source project that aims to create a social blockchain platform for fashion and outfit enthusiasts, using the Wefacelook token as a means of exchange within the platform. The platform will integrate blockchain authentication with various social platforms, such as Facebook. WeFacelook addresses the need for a decentralized and transparent social network tailored to the fashion community, allowing users to share, discover, and trade fashion items with ease.

## Problem
The fashion industry currently lacks a dedicated social platform that combines the benefits of blockchain technology with the social aspects of traditional networks. WeFacelook aims to fill this gap by providing a secure, transparent, and user-friendly platform for fashion enthusiasts to connect, share, and trade items.

## Project Components
The WeFacelook project consists of the following components:

### Wefacelook Token
The Wefacelook token is a non-fungible token based on the Ethereum blockchain, created to be used as a means of exchange within the WeFacelook platform. The token is issued through a smart contract and can be used to reward users or pay for services offered within the platform.

### Weapp
Weapp is an application that allows users to access their Facebook profiles using blockchain as a means of authentication. Users can use their Facebook account to log in to Weapp, but the actions they take on the platform (such as sending messages or posting content) are recorded on the blockchain and are visible only to users who possess the Wefacelook token.

### WeFacelook Social Blockchain Platform
The WeFacelook social blockchain platform is an open-source platform based on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can use the platform to upload images of their outfits to a virtual closet and categorize them appropriately, with transactions stored on a blockchain. The platform offers the following features:

- Create and share content (photos and videos) related to outfits and fashion trends, with the ability to comment on or appreciate other users' outfits.
- User interaction system, through which users can follow other users and receive notifications about new outfits published, with interactions stored on a blockchain.
- Advanced search function to find specific outfits based on categories, tags, or other criteria, using blockchain-based search algorithms.
- Ability to buy or sell clothing through the platform, with an integrated payment system based on blockchain technology.
- Connection with other existing social networks, like Facebook or Instagram, to facilitate sharing of outfits and content.
- Development of machine learning and AI techniques to analyze user data and suggest related outfits and products.
- Implementation of an internal messaging function to enable users to communicate with each other within the platform.
