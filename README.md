WeFacelook

WeFacelook is an open-source project that aims to create a social blockchain platform for Facebook, using the Wefacelook token as a means of exchange within the platform.

Project Components
The WeFacelook project consists of the following components:

Wefacelook Token
The Wefacelook token is a non-fungible token based on the Ethereum blockchain, created to be used as a means of exchange within the Facelook social blockchain platform. The token is issued through a smart contract and can be used to reward users or pay for services offered within the platform.

Weapp
Weapp is an application that allows Facebook users to access their timeline, messages, notifications, and other Facebook features using blockchain as a means of authentication. Users can use their Facebook account to log in to Weapp, but the actions they take on the platform (like sending messages or posting content) are recorded on the blockchain and only visible to users who possess the Wefacelook token.

Facelook Social Blockchain Platform
The Facelook social blockchain platform is an open-source platform based on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can use the platform to upload images of their outfits to a virtual closet and categorize them appropriately, with transactions stored on a blockchain. The platform offers the following features:

Ability to create and share content (photos and videos) related to outfits and fashion trends, with the ability to comment or appreciate other usersâ€™ outfits.
User interaction system, through which users can follow other users and receive notifications about new outfits published, with interactions stored on a blockchain.
Advanced search function to find specific outfits based on categories, tags, or other criteria, using blockchain-based search algorithms.
Ability to buy or sell clothing through the platform, with an integrated payment system based on blockchain technology.
Connection with other existing social networks, like Facebook or Instagram, to facilitate sharing of outfits and content.
Development of machine learning and AI techniques to analyze user data and suggest related outfits and products.
Implementation of an internal messaging function to enable users to communicate with each other within the platform.
Requirements
To develop and use the WeFacelook project, the following requirements are needed:

Knowledge of Ethereum and blockchain technologies
Experience in web application development
Knowledge of programming languages like JavaScript, Solidity, and React
A fast Internet connection for using the Facelook social blockchain platform.
Roadmap

Creation of the Wefacelook token: Q3 2023
Creation of Weapp: Q4 2023
Development of the Facelook social blockchain platform: Q1 2024 - Q4 2024
